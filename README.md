# hello-world
I am a community college student trying to learn computer science

I know how to code in C# for Unity and have a 2-year certification for it.

I am interested in learning more code to create video games and various programs while knowing how to debug them in a real-world environment.

Currently, my hobbies are collecting transformers and playing video games.
